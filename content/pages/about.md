Summary: About me

I tend to be excited about a broad range of problems at once. A non-exhaustive list includes:

- Making computing more accessible and building intuitive computing systems
- Programming as craft, learning and teaching programming more effectively, and programming and computing as a tool for thought
- Programming for the internet, distributed systems, and infrastructure
- Hardware, and building computing systems that interact with the "world of atoms"
- Using computing to reduce human suffering and increase human thriving
- Building and participating in organizations that are unusually effective, or greater than the sum of their parts

I did a batch at the Recurse Center from July-September of 2016, and again from January-March of 2020. The Recurse Center is a self-directed “writers retreat” for programmers of all levels, backgrounds, and interests. It's one of the most interesting programming communities I've encountered, and my favorite educational experience of my life so far. And, it's free to attend! You can learn more at [recurse.com](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=70c642aa7102a1a2b43dc2ba3585c703), or by reading my [Return Statement]({filename}/journal/return-statement.md).

Before I started programming, I studied [Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology](http://www.nbb.emory.edu) and worked in neuroscience research labs at [Emory University](https://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/primary/weinshenker-david.html) and [McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School](https://www.chartofflab.com/). My research interests involved the neural mechanisms of drug addiction and withdrawal. I contributed to several academic journal articles and presented our work at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington, DC.
